#   also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions
#   of the license of that module. An independent module is a module which
#   is not derived from or based on libstdhl. If you modify libstdhl, you
#   may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are
#   not obliged to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception
